Uses React, React-Redux, Redux-Thunk, and Materialize CSS for the frontend, MongoDB to store user data, Passport JS for Authentication flow, Stripe API for handling billing, and an Express server with custom middleware for the backend. Emails are sent with SendGrid and the application is deployed via Render.
